## The purpose of creating Rust Constructor

During the development of [Targeted Vector](https://github.com/ChepleBob30/Targeted-Vector/), we encountered some problems that egui couldn't solve, so we expanded many tools. To enable more people to develop conveniently, we created Rust Constructor.

## How to contribute to Rust Constructor

Rust Constructor is an open-source project. However, due to personal reasons, I don't want anyone to submit code directly (because this would make the development and code submission work chaotic and difficult). If you encounter any bugs or have any functional suggestions while using Rust Constructor, please create an issue in the GitHub repository or send it directly to me (<Cheple_Bob@outlook.com>).
